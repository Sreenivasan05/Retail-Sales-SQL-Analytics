# Retail Sales SQL Analytics Case Study

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze retail sales transaction data using SQL
to extract meaningful business insights related to sales performance,
profitability, customer behavior, and time-based trends.

## Dataset
- Source: OpenDataBay – Retail Sales Analytics Dataset
- Total Records: 1,195
- Key Columns: Order ID, Amount, Profit, Quantity, Category, Sub-Category,
  Payment Mode, Order Date, Customer, State, City, Year-Month

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- SQL (CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregations)

##  Key Questions Answered
- Which categories and sub-categories drive the most revenue and profit?
- Who are the top customers and how much do they contribute?
- Are there loss-making products or regions?
- How do sales and profits trend over time?

## Key Insights

- Sales and profits are evenly distributed across Office Supplies, Electronics, and Furniture, each contributing ~₹2M in sales, indicating a diversified and low-risk revenue mix.
- Sub-categories such as Paper, Markers, Chairs, Tables, and Printers deliver disproportionately high profit margins, making them key profit drivers despite similar overall category sales.
- Sales show a steady upward trend over time, with noticeable month-to-month fluctuations, reflecting seasonal demand patterns common in retail businesses.
- Approximately 58% of customers are repeat buyers, and a small group of top customers contributes a significant share of total revenue, highlighting the importance of customer retention strategies.
- Several cities generate high sales volumes but relatively lower profit margins, suggesting opportunities for cost optimization or pricing strategy improvements at a regional level.
